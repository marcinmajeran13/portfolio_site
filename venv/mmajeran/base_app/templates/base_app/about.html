    <h1>Hi,</h1>

    <h1>I'm Marcin Majeran</h1>

    <p>a Computer Science/Software development second year student on University of Liverpool. I was born in Poland and decided to go study abroad. </p>
    <p>Beside a material that I have learned during lectures and tutorials(still learning)
        i also learn new things on my own. I am focused on Python programming language.
        So far I finished:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla on Udemy, and Python and Django</li>
            <li>Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp from the same author</li>
        </ul>

    <p>After the second course I have decided I want to create this portfolio site.
        So, as you can deduce the whole site is developed in Django, it was fun process, which
        gave me horrendous satisfaction. On the way I learnt basics of how work with Version Control.
        In my case it was GitHub, link to my account is in title section.
    </p>

    <p>The main reason I have created this website is to show what I can do as programmer
    so far. Also, as I love technology and as my hobby repair some devices for friends or myself,
    I decided to apply a blog section(under Writing button). It gives me much fun to describe
    all the processes I perform to make the device work again. Also it improves my Writing in English skils.
    </p>

    <p>As I am still doing research in various fields of programming to determine what I really want to do
        in future I am going to
    link here my mobile apps or other projects, which development I decided to check/learn at the moment. </p>

    <p>All views expressed on this webiste are my own :)</p>
