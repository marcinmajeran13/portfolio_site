    <h1>I'm Marcin Majeran</h1>

    <p>a Computer Science with Software Development second-year student at the University of Liverpool.
        I was born in Poland and decided to go to study abroad</p>
    <p>Beside a material that I have learnt during lectures and tutorials (still learning), I also learn new things on
        my own. I am focused on the Python programming language. So far I have finished:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla</li>
        <li>Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp by Jose Portilla</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After the second course, I have decided that I want to create this portfolio site. So, as you can deduce the
        whole
        site is developed in Django. It was a fun process, which gave me enormous satisfaction. On the way, I learnt
        basics of working with Version Control. In my case it was GitHub, link to my account is in the title
        section.
    </p>

    <p>The main reason why I have created this website is to show what I can do as a programmer so far. Also, as I love
        technology and as my hobby repair some devices for friends or myself, I decided to apply a blog section (under
        Writing button). It gives me much fun to describe all the processes I perform to make the device work again.
        Also, it improves my Writing in English skills.
    </p>

    <p>As I am still researching in various fields of programming to determine what I want to do in future, I am going
        to link here my mobile apps or other projects, which development I decided to check/learn at the moment.</p>

    <p>All views expressed on this website are my own :)</p>
